# Action Funding Proposal

Abie Fund is a non-profit DAO proposal.

The idea is to **allow people to fund one specific cause**.

* Donors become art of the community and get one right to vote (regardless of the amount).
* Project proposals are voted by the community. 
* A vote triggers a transaction with the recipient.

## Note

Abie Fund community's statement of intent is : 

>We want to fund non-violent initiatives for peace in Israel-Palestine.
