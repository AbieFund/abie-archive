## Welcome to Abie!

Abie Fund is a DAO that includes a voting system based on "liquid democracy". The community vote triggers a transaction to the beneficiary. We vote when a proposal is submitted or when someone asks for membership (Sybil-proof).

## Use cases

* A group of people that want to fund initiatives for one specific cause
* A transparent common account, easy to manage and ridiculously easy to deploy and configure quickly
* A corporate brand that would allow its customers to directly manage the funds allocated to certain objectives
* A city hall that would give more decision power to people on one specific project
* A group of friends trading together, voting every week to adjust their collective investment

They can all use Abie to **take collective decisions and actions in an intuitive and easy way**.

## Implemented Features

* Enable external donations (including anon)
* Anyone can submit a proposal
* The vote of the community triggers the transaction to the beneficiary
* Any donor can request membership
* Members have one right to vote each proposal or membership request
* As the vote follow the rules of liquid democracy, you can choose (or become) a delegate
* You can switch delegate or switch to direct democracy at anytime
